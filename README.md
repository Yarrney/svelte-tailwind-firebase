# Svelte + TailwindCSS + Firebase Example

Basic template for integration of Tailwind CSS with Svelte JS. Designed to be used for a single page application (SPA).  

This has also been setup to use Firebase (Firestore, eventually auth, and hosting).

If you need server side rendering (SSR) then consider [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) - I've also made a tempalate for this, visit [sapper-tailwind-firebase-host](https://github.com/Yarrney/sapper-tailwind-firebase-host).

## Features

* Dark/Light Theme Example using CSS variables
* Hash based routing from [svelte-spa-router](https://github.com/ItalyPaleAle/svelte-spa-router)

## Installation instructions
Simply clone the repo via degit and have a blast! 

`npx degit Yarrney/svelte-tailwindCSS`
